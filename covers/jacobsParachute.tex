\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I believe my skills and experience strongly match those requested in your posting for an Orion parachute flight simulation analyst. 
In addition to degrees in mechanical engineering and physics, I have specific skills relevant to your needs.
While leading the new airframe project for the Portland State Aerospace Society, I have: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item verified airframe characteristics using simulations in C++ (OpenFOAM);
	\item written, revised, and fulfilled various subsystem requirements for our rocket and cubesat projects;
	\item written technical procedures for other engineers, informational posters for the general public, and a \href{http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-5365}{conference paper};
	\item directed projects for the rocket and cubesat, collaborating between engineering disciplines and mentoring younger students.
\end{itemize}
I use a Linux environment on a daily basis and am proficient in MATLAB, Python, and R.
Please visit my \href{http://joedang.github.io}{website} and \href{http://github.com/Joedang/Portfolio}{portfolio} for more details on my skills and experience.

I'm eager to contribute to the aerospace industry, so thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response. 

\closing{Sincerely,\\ Joe Shields}
