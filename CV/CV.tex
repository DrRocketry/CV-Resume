\begin{itemize}
%\item Intel Science Expo 2006, Beaverton â€“ Hillsboro: $3^\text{rd}$ place in Medicine \& Health
\item Director of Airframe Design and Manufacture
	\hfill\textbf{Dec. 2015 -- present} %remember to add links to these things
	\par Working with the \href{http://psas.pdx.edu/}{Portland State Aerospace Society}, I designed and manufactured an \href{https://github.com/psas/sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0}{open-hardware carbon fiber airframe for the group's 3\textsuperscript{rd} generation sounding rocket}. 
	To this end, I also managed all the airframe sub-projects being developed by our student and professional members. 
	I presented a poster on this topic at AIAA SPACE 2016, with \href{http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-5365}{the corresponding paper available in the proceedings}. 
%	\subitem \href{https://github.com/psas/sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0}{Created 
%		an open-hardware carbon fiber rocket airframe} for the 
%		\href{http://psas.pdx.edu/}{Portland State Aerospace Society}
%	\subitem Managed interdisciplinary projects among students and professionals
%	\subitem Published and presented \href{http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.2016-5365}{a conference paper on the project for AIAA SPACE 2016}
\item PCC Art Beat competition \hfill\textbf{May 2012}
	\par I composed an original piece for the PCC chamber ensemble, a group of roughly 30 musicians. 
	I conducted the ensemble in the practices and final performance of this piece.
	The piece also earned 1\textsuperscript{st} place in PCC's Art Beat composition competition. 
%	\subitem Composed and conducted an original piece for about 30 members
%	\subitem Earned $1^\text{st}$ place in the composition competition
